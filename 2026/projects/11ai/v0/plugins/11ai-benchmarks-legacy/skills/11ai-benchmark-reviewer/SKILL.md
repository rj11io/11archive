# 11ai Benchmark Reviewer

Act as the publication gate. Read
[the shared contracts](../../references/artifact-contracts.md) and validate output
against `../../schemas/review.schema.json`. Copy owned metrics; never recreate them.

## Select the cycle

Select `benchmark/cycles/<cycle-id>/cycle.json`. Resume the latest draft only
when its frozen run membership and hashes still match. Never fold new runs or a
changed rubric into an already reviewed cycle. Preserve historical cycles.

In sync mode, discover every missing or stale review in scope and process them
in publication-sequence order. Do not rewrite an unchanged historical cycle
merely because a newer interim cycle exists.

## Run the complete gate

Report all failures together:

1. Configuration and cycle validate; benchmark/cycle/run IDs are unique.
2. Included runs share template/content/config hashes and each exact prompt
   instance hash resolves to its frozen file.
3. Every included run is finished and has the required audit state.
4. Rubric markdown, rubric JSON, judging evidence, judge files, and aggregate
   hashes agree; every judge prompt template/instance hash resolves.
5. Every aggregate judge ID resolves to one complete AI or human artifact;
   drafts and duplicates are excluded.
6. Screenshots and other evidence referenced by the cycle exist and match when
   present. Missing or failed evidence is a recorded coverage limitation when
   the judge artifact marks the affected dimensions unavailable; it is not a
   reason to discard otherwise defensible judgments.
7. Canonical accounting includes every discovered thread, all required scopes,
   verified pricing/provenance, and a passing reconciliation to total. If
   usage-bearing transcripts are present, matched benchmark-run threads must
   have numeric token and cost totals; an all-null measured cost set is a gate
   failure owned by the token accountant.
8. Ledger/cost/audit/judging values agree with their owning artifacts.
9. Required publication metadata and canonical URLs are present or explicitly
   unavailable.
10. No owned output is newer than or inconsistent with its source digest.
11. Release type/sequence, previous-cycle link, and run-plan coverage snapshot
    agree for lifecycle-aware cycles. A final cycle satisfies closure policy or
    freezes a waiver. Preserve older schema-v2 artifacts that predate these
    optional fields, label lifecycle coverage unknown/legacy, and never invent
    prompt hashes or mutate their frozen cohort.

Missing optional cost fields may publish as unavailable only when the source
transcript genuinely lacks that class or pricing. Missing runs, missing judge
inputs, non-reconciling totals, broken hashes, or evidence-integrity failures
fail the gate. Missing evidence itself is a warning when partial judging
records its limitation and preserves the affected dimensions as unavailable.
Point each failure to its owning skill.

## Consolidate all reviewed data

Write `benchmark/cycles/<cycle-id>/review/data.json`. Preserve the full detail
needed for drill-down and visualization:

- benchmark/config/cycle identity, objectives, skills, policies, hashes, refs;
- campaign state, release type/sequence, desired/complete/time-gated/failed/
  excluded coverage, closure policy, waiver, and prior/current cycle links;
- every run's harness/provider/model/effort/version/environment/timing metadata;
- audits, commands, warnings, errors, evidence surfaces and availability;
- weighted/dimension scores, ranks, holistic signals, judge composition,
  dispersion, disagreement, blinding, and judge metadata;
- normalized token classes, raw/provider usage, per-class costs, rates,
  efficiency, tooling/session metadata, and cost-quality metrics;
- benchmark, judge, each identified-other, unidentified, benchmark+judge, and
  total accounting scopes;
- metadata coverage, unavailable fields, stale/inferred/reported markers;
- source/report/deployment URLs and publication targets.

The reviewer may reshape owned fields into display-friendly arrays but may not
derive new score, cost, or cross-benchmark facts. Record a `sourceDigest`; if an
existing complete data file has the same digest, do not rewrite it.

## Propagate idempotently

Update only marker-delimited sections owned by this skill in benchmark, parent,
and root READMEs. Key markers by benchmark and cycle or by stable leaderboard
identity; replace matching sections wholesale and never append duplicates.

At one benchmark, show verdict, runs, score/audit/judge summary, all accounting
scope totals, cost/point, freshness, caveats, and report link. At parent/root
levels use analyzer-owned aggregates and compact summaries with sample size.

For websites, leave reviewed data canonical and delegate code/design/content/
index synchronization to `$11ai-benchmark-sync`, which invokes
`$11ai-benchmark-www` once at the end. Never hardcode values into components or
touch a general project-site workflow.

After a successful gate, update `benchmark/current.json` atomically with cycle
ID, release type, publication sequence, and review digest against
`../../schemas/current.schema.json`. An interim moves current but leaves the
campaign open. When publish-cycle orchestrates the full report/sync gate, let
`finalize-cycle.mjs` perform this pointer update so current never advances ahead
of its projections. Publishing externally still requires user confirmation.

## Async rules

- Raw run/audit/judge/accounting artifacts are never overwritten by review.
- A changed source digest makes the review stale; regenerate the same draft
  cycle or create a new cycle according to frozen-input rules.
- Historical reviewed cycles remain addressable.
- Re-running with unchanged inputs produces zero duplicate sections and ideally
  a zero diff.
- Reporter and websites consume this exact file, keeping all surfaces aligned.
- When analyzer output changes, rerun only marker-owned parent/root README
  projections; do not regenerate cycle facts.
