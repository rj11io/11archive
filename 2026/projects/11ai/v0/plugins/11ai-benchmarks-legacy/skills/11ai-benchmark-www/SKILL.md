# 11ai Benchmark WWW

Build the public exploration layer for an 11ai benchmark tree. Focus on the
benchmark catalog, progressively reveal every reviewed datum, and keep all
levels synchronized across async cycles. This skill is distinct from any
general project-site workflow; never edit or invoke one here.

## Non-negotiable scope boundary

This skill owns only non-run exploration UI: the root/parent/benchmark/cycle
catalog, its routes, components, styles, charts, navigation, and generated
website data such as `site-index.json`. It may read reviewed run metadata to
display or link to it, but it must never modify the benchmark's run
applications or run-owned artifacts.

Treat these paths as read-only inputs:

- benchmark run apps such as `app/<run-id>/` or any directory whose name is a
  known run ID from `runs.json`;
- `benchmark/runs/`, cycle `runs/`, prompts, generated candidate artifacts,
  run outputs, and run manifests;
- judging/evidence directories, including screenshots and interaction traces;
- benchmark-owned token/cost ledgers, review data, reports, cycle state, and
  `current.json`.

The skill must not “fix” a run app, regenerate evidence, refresh screenshots,
rewrite benchmark results, or patch benchmark data to make the website render.
If source data is malformed, preserve the source and render an explicit
missing/invalid state in the exploration UI. Run
`scripts/verify-www-scope.mjs` against the planned changed paths before
finishing; a protected-path violation is a hard stop.

Read [artifact contracts](../../references/artifact-contracts.md),
[the website matrix](../../references/website-data-and-visualizations.md), and the
[benchmark WWW visualization and table patterns](../../references/benchmark-www-visualization-patterns.md).
Apply the 11ai design language to every site.

## 1. Inventory the complete tree

Walk from the user-named root and discover:

- root collection and existing root website;
- parent/version/family directories and their websites;
- benchmark repos through `benchmark/benchmark.json`, legacy ledgers, or
  reviewed cycle data;
- all reviewed cycles, reports, runs, evidence, analyzer outputs, and canonical
  URLs;
- run plans, lifecycle state, current pointers, interim/final release sequence,
  coverage waivers, and time-gated targets;
- website application stack, package manager, shadcn components, chart
  dependency, theme, fonts, deployment config, and repo guidance at every
  non-run website level. Do not treat a benchmark run app as a website target.

Do not stop at the first `www/`. Cover every root, parent, and child app found.
Record ambiguous hierarchy before editing; prefer existing repository grouping.

## 2. Build one recursive data model

Generate stable hierarchy nodes for `root → parent → benchmark → cycle → run`
using `../../schemas/site-index.schema.json`. Each node contains parent/children,
canonical/source URLs, compact summary, complete reviewed payload reference,
metadata coverage, freshness, and source digest.

Consume, in order:

1. cycle `review/data.json`;
2. analyzer `leaderboard.json` for cross-benchmark facts;
3. accountant-owned cost/efficiency metrics already copied into review data;
4. lifecycle/run-plan fields copied into reviewed data;
5. legacy reviewed `benchmark/report/data.json` only as a compatibility path.

Never calculate scores, prices, cost/point, normalized ranks, or reconciliation
inside UI components. It is fine to transform owned arrays for chart libraries.

Rebuild indexes from all sources and replace entries by stable ID. Never append
on each build. If source digest is unchanged, produce no data-file diff.
Use the bundled deterministic scanner as the baseline implementation:

```bash
node <plugin>/scripts/build-site-index.mjs <benchmark-tree-root> <app-data>/site-index.json
```

The `run` nodes above are read-only catalog records. They are not permission
to edit run-level applications or artifacts. The scanner may read all reviewed
inputs, but its only write target is the website-owned index file.

## 3. Information architecture and density

Every non-run level supports breadcrumbs, up/down navigation, latest reviewed
state, cycle history, source/report links, and drill-down into the exact
underlying metadata. Run records may be linked or displayed as read-only
detail, but the skill does not update the run's application UI.

- **Root website:** retain the spacious 11ai editorial rhythm and overview.
- **All non-root websites/pages:** use a compact analytical mode—smaller hero,
  reduced vertical padding, tighter cards, compact filters, dense tables, and
  more information above the fold while preserving readability.
- **Benchmark list:** primary content at root and parent levels, not a secondary
  marketing section.
- **Benchmark/cycle:** progressive detail from summary to raw provenance;
  never hide missing or unavailable metadata. Run records are read-only.

Prefer one shared component/data vocabulary across separate apps without
forcing a monorepo or copying static result prose.

## 4. Benchmark catalog

Display at least objective, skill under test, freshness, cycle/run counts,
winner/score, benchmark cost, judge AI/human composition, value pick, audit
state, evidence surfaces, and metadata coverage.

Search benchmark, objective, skill, provider, model, harness, run, and metadata.
Filter group/objective/skill/provider/harness/model/effort/cycle/date/review,
audit, judge type/count, surface, score, cost, cost/point, wall time, cache rate,
scope, and field availability. Sort newest/name/score/cost/value/runs/judges,
cache efficiency, coverage, or completeness. Persist all state in URL params.

Provide column selection, compact/card view where useful, keyboard operation,
empty states, result counts, and reset controls. On narrow screens prioritize
identity, status, winner, score, and cost with expandable metadata.

## 5. Visualize every useful dimension

Prefer the existing shadcn chart component. If absent, the target uses a
compatible React/Tailwind/shadcn stack, and installation is authorized, install
the official shadcn chart component and required dependency. Do not install a
parallel chart system beside one already present.

Implement the full applicable matrix from the website reference: quality,
dimensions, disagreement, AI/human judging, audit failures, token composition,
per-class cost, cache/reasoning efficiency, wall time, cost/point, accounting
scopes, identified-other labels, unidentified work, total discovered work,
coverage, pairwise performance, model/harness/provider patterns, operations
overhead, metadata availability, and cycle timelines.

Link list/filter state to charts. Use exact-value tooltips, stable configuration
colors, accessible controls, table fallbacks, sample size, provenance, missing
states, responsive layouts, and reduced motion. Apply the visualization and
table-card contract in the visualization patterns reference: synchronized
chart/table views, URL-persisted filters, scoped exports, grouped sortable
tables, and explicit units/directionality/status. Prefer honest bars, lines,
scatterplots, matrices, and small multiples over decorative charts.

## 6. Preserve all metadata

Give every reviewed field a display path. High-value facts appear in summaries;
secondary metadata appears in expandable panels; full provenance appears on
run/cycle detail pages. Include raw/normalized token semantics, field
provenance, unavailable values, rates, thread/session/tool metadata, errors,
evidence, audit commands, judges, disagreement, scopes, cycle/source hashes,
and publication freshness.

Do not overload the initial list. Progressive disclosure is not omission.

## 7. Copy and calls to action

Use plain, evidence-backed copy. Every benchmark exploration surface must
provide exactly these two CTA references:

- **Run this benchmark** — give the user concise local reproduction
  instructions, link to the benchmark's GitHub repository, and link to the
  relevant results page. At benchmark and cycle levels, the results link must
  point to the current results or the exact benchmark/cycle page being viewed;
  at root and parent levels, provide these links per benchmark card rather
  than using an ambiguous global target.
- **Run your own benchmark** — invite the user to create a new benchmark with
  the plugin, linking to `https://ai.rj11.io/plugins/benchmarks`.

Use these exact labels and meanings consistently at root, parent, benchmark,
cycle, and run levels. Do not collapse the two actions into a generic
repository link or omit either action. If a GitHub, local-run, or results URL
is unavailable, show an explicit unavailable state and preserve the other
available links.

## 8. Apply the 11ai design language

Follow the 11ai design language: neutral semantic OKLCH tokens, Inter/sans
prose plus Geist-style mono metadata, thin borders, restrained radii/shadows,
type-led hierarchy, uppercase mono kickers, one quiet accent, light/dark parity,
subtle hover motion, and high information clarity. Reuse the target's semantic
tokens and components. Non-root compactness must not become cramped.

## 9. Static generation and async updates

Scan source artifacts at build time, generate every hierarchy route, and keep
malformed/partial benchmarks from breaking the whole tree. Label stale/draft
data and publish only reviewed facts as final.

Adding a benchmark, parent, reviewed cycle, run, judge, scope, or metadata field
must appear after the next build without component edits. Historical cycle URLs
remain valid. The latest pointer changes only after review.

When a non-run website app exists, synchronize its data adapters, routes,
components, copy, filters, charts, design tokens, and navigation with the
latest review/analyzer contracts. Preserve unrelated user code and local
conventions; replace stable owned sections or generated data by ID rather than
recreating the app. Show
interim/final badges, publication history, completed versus desired coverage,
time-gated targets, exclusions, waivers, and campaign-open state.

## 10. Verify

- Validate indexes and every reviewed input.
- Run `node scripts/verify-www-scope.mjs <tree-root> <changed-path>...` and
  confirm every changed path is website-owned or generated website data.
- Typecheck, lint, test, and production-build every modified app.
- Verify generated route counts at all levels.
- Test root plus one parent, benchmark, cycle, and run page.
- Test search/filter/sort/URL persistence and chart/list linkage.
- Reconcile displayed accounting totals and token classes to source artifacts.
- Test light/dark, desktop/mobile, keyboard, reduced motion, and missing data.
- Check both CTA references, the GitHub/source link, the local reproduction
  instructions, and one exact results deep link per level.
- Build twice; the second build must not duplicate data or create a content diff.
- Verify an existing-app upgrade, not only greenfield generation, and confirm
  stale copy, design, and chart surfaces were refreshed from canonical data.

## Hard failures

- Using the general project-site skill instead of this benchmark skill.
- Covering only the root website while parent/child apps exist.
- A spacious marketing layout on dense non-root analytical pages.
- Hardcoded benchmark lists, counts, results, or chart data.
- Dropping unrecognized metadata instead of preserving it.
- Hiding judge, unidentified, identified-other, or total accounting scopes.
- Recomputing owned benchmark metrics in UI code.
- Modifying any benchmark run application, run folder, prompt, evidence,
  screenshot, run manifest, cost ledger, review artifact, report, cycle state,
  or `current.json`.
- Using a benchmark run app as the target website when a non-run exploration
  website is available.
- Duplicate nodes or marker sections after a resumed or next-day cycle.
