name: 11ai-benchmark-analyzer
description: "Aggregate or synchronize reviewed cycles across multiple benchmark repositories into coverage-aware model, harness, provider, effort, cost, compliance, judge, token, metadata, lifecycle, and trend analysis. Use for cross-benchmark leaderboards, normalized comparisons, cost-quality frontiers, recurring patterns, historical trends, or refreshing stale analyzer output after reviewed data changes. Requires at least two reviewed benchmarks and never edits their source artifacts."

# 11ai Benchmark Analyzer

Analyze reviewed cycle data, not mutable raw results. Read
[the shared contracts](../../references/artifact-contracts.md). Report discovered,
skipped, stale, failed, and partially covered benchmarks before ranking.

In sync mode, discover all reviewed inputs under the requested parent and
rebuild only when their set or bytes change. Keep interim cycles in history but
use each benchmark's `current.json` cycle for the current leaderboard unless a
historical snapshot is requested. Label interim/final coverage explicitly.

## Normalize fairly

Raw totals and raw ranks are not comparable across rubrics or field sizes. For
each eligible run compute only analyzer-owned cross-benchmark views:

- normalized rank percentile: `1 - (rank - 1) / (entrants - 1)`;
- relative score: total divided by the benchmark winner's total;
- pairwise result only where both configurations entered the same benchmark.

Keep repeats as observations of one harness+model+effort configuration. Segment
different prompt/content/rubric/config versions and reviewed cycles; never
blend incompatible cohorts.

## Produce comprehensive analysis

Per configuration/provider/model/harness/effort include:

- benchmarks entered, eligible total, coverage, wins, ties, disqualifications;
- median normalized rank, mean relative score, range/IQR, pairwise record;
- score/dimension patterns through an explicit canonical dimension mapping;
- total and per-scope cost, token classes, cache/reasoning/tooling efficiency,
  wall time, cost/point, and efficient-frontier membership;
- audit failure rate, judge count/type, disagreement, metadata coverage;
- trends across cycles, harness/model versions, pricing, and time.
- planned, complete, time-gated, failed, and excluded lifecycle coverage,
  release sequence/type, campaign state, and time-to-coverage.

Preserve all useful metadata for filtering and visualization. Avoid a direct
claim between configurations with weak common-benchmark overlap; show them in
partial-coverage tables instead.

## Output

Write versioned `leaderboard.json` and `LEADERBOARD.md` at the requested parent.
Use stable configuration IDs, input source digests, and cycle IDs. Rebuild from
all reviewed inputs; never append arithmetic to a prior aggregate. If the source
digest is unchanged, do not rewrite.

Include chart-ready arrays for normalized rank, relative score, pairwise matrix,
coverage, cost-quality, dimensions, audit failures, token classes, scopes,
judge composition/disagreement, metadata coverage, and timelines. Websites may
reshape but not recompute these aggregates.

## Caveats

Print N and coverage beside every aggregate. Explain that these are coding
benchmarks scored by a mixture of declared judge types. Surface contradictory
benchmarks rather than hiding them in a mean. Treat tiny samples as directional.

The reviewer distributes analyzer output; this skill remains read-only toward
benchmark repositories and does not edit READMEs or websites.
