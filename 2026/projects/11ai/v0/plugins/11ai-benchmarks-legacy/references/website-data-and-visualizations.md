# Benchmark website data and visualization matrix

Build every page from reviewed cycle data, analyzer output, and accountant
artifacts. Never scrape rendered prose when structured data exists.

For the interaction, tooltip, filter, export, table, responsive, accessibility,
and provenance requirements behind these visualizations, read the
[benchmark WWW visualization and table patterns](./benchmark-www-visualization-patterns.md).

## Hierarchy

- Root collection: all parent groups and benchmarks; spacious editorial hero.
- Parent/group: children, cross-child aggregates, history; compact header.
- Benchmark: reviewed cycles, runs, evidence, scores, costs; compact header.
- Cycle: judge/audit/accounting snapshot and report; dense analytical layout.
- Run: full metadata, evidence, token/cost trace, audit and scores.

Every node has breadcrumbs, parent/child links, canonical source links, and a
stable `nodeId`. Non-root sites use smaller type, tighter vertical padding,
denser controls, compact cards, and tables as the default representation.

## Primary benchmark list

Show objective, skill under test, freshness, run count, winner, score, total
benchmark cost, value pick, judge composition, audit status, available
surfaces, cycle count, interim/final state, completed versus desired targets,
time-gated targets, and campaign-open state. Search benchmark/model/harness/provider/objective.
Persist search, filters, sorting, columns, and view in URL parameters.

Support filters for group, objective, skill, provider, harness, model, effort,
cycle/date, review status, audit status, judge type/count, surface, score, cost,
cost per point, wall time, cache efficiency, and metadata availability. Sort by
newest, name, score, cost, value, runs, judges, cache rate, or coverage.

## Visualization inventory

Prefer shadcn charts (Recharts). Install the official chart component only when
the project is compatible and installation is authorized. Link charts to the
same filter state as the list.

- Cost vs score scatter with efficient frontier.
- Rank and weighted score bars.
- Dimension comparison and judge dispersion.
- Holistic rank vs rubric rank.
- Human vs AI judge distributions.
- Token composition: uncached, cached read, cache writes, output, reasoning.
- Per-class and per-model cost composition.
- Accounting scopes: benchmark, judge, each identified-other label,
  unidentified, benchmark+judge, and total.
- Cache hit/write efficiency, output/input ratio, cost/minute, cost/turn.
- Wall time vs quality and cost per point.
- Audit failures by check and configuration.
- Harness/model/provider participation and disqualification rates.
- Benchmark coverage, pairwise results, normalized rank, and relative score.
- Cycle timeline showing new runs, judges, score movement, cost, and freshness.
- Lifecycle coverage showing planned, complete, available, time-gated, failed,
  and excluded targets across interim publication sequences through final close.
- Operations overhead, pricing changes, missing/unavailable metadata.

Every chart needs exact-value tooltips, legend, stable configuration colors,
keyboard-accessible controls, textual/table fallback, sample size, provenance,
and an explicit missing-data state. Honor reduced motion. Do not use radar charts
when a grouped bar or small multiples communicate values more accurately.

## Calls to action

Every benchmark exploration surface must provide exactly these two CTA
references:

- **Run this benchmark**: give concise local reproduction instructions, link
  to the benchmark's GitHub repository, and link to the relevant results page.
  At benchmark and cycle levels, link to the current results or exact
  benchmark/cycle page being viewed; at root and parent levels, provide these
  links per benchmark card rather than using an ambiguous global target.
- **Run your own benchmark**: create a new benchmark via
  `https://ai.rj11.io/plugins/benchmarks`.

Use these exact labels and meanings consistently at every hierarchy level. Do
not collapse the two actions into a generic repository link or omit either
action. If a GitHub, local-run, or results URL is unavailable, show an explicit
unavailable state and preserve the other available links.
